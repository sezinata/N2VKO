Integrating node embeddings and biological annotations for genes to predict disease-gene associations https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-018-0662-y

In this study, multiple feature selection (MRMR, EARTH, VarImp, Stepwise Linear Model) methods have been examined. In addition to these FS techniques also ROSE and
SMOTE oversampling methods have been performed.

These techniques are applied to the concatenated feature vectors consist of node2vec embeddings and biological annotations (downloaded Keywords from Uniprot).
